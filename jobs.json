        "The time updates every second using a client-side setInterval, with cleanup on unmount",
        "The clock digits are red (#ff0000 or similar) on a solid black (#000000) background",
        "The font is monospace (font-mono in Tailwind) to evoke a classic segmented display",
        "The clock container has rounded corners, padding, and is horizontally centered in the footer",
        "The styling is identical in light mode and dark mode (black background with red digits in both)",
        "Clicking the clock opens https://www.nba.com in a new tab (target='_blank', rel='noopener noreferrer')",
        "The clock has cursor-pointer and a visible hover state (e.g., subtle glow or brightness change)",
        "The clock link has an aria-label describing the destination (e.g., 'Visit NBA.com')"
